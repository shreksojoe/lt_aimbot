#LT Aimbot
## Purpose
This is LT Aimbot, used for cheating at making tickets in Label Traxx.

## Download:

1. [Version Prehistoric Available Here](https://github.com/shreksojoe/lt_aimbot/releases/tag/Beta)
2. click on the .exe file and it will download (maybe download to Desktop if your cool)
3. Windows did not protect you PC: click more info and run anyway.
4. if the terminal that pops up bothers you, Slack me and I'll consider removing it :/

## How to Use

Using this template:

```Customer Name,Order Number ,Ship Date, Quantity, price (per unit), Address, Notes(Optional)```
Input all necessary information into a csv.
Launch LT Aimbot.exe and click the "Browse CSV" and navigate to the csv you want to turn into a ticket.
The program will take control over your mouse and keyboard.

## CAUTION
This program is in it's early stages and has some notable limitations:
    1. Can currently only do tickets with one product (working on this)
    2. moving the window is sketchy, as the program uses screen coordinates to know where to click it. May or may not reset
    3. Cannot be run in the background. You will not be able to use your computer while this is running
